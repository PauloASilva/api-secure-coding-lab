API Security Labs
=================

A collection of API back-ends, some of them intentionally vulnerable, to learn
and practice API concepts and API security.

## How-to Use

If you have `git` installed you can simply clone this repository: 

```
git clone https://github.com/PauloASilva/api-security-labs
```

Otherwise you can [download its content as a `ZIP` archive][1] which you should
then extract in your machine.

[Docker][2] and [Docker Compose][2] are both required in order to run the API
back-ends in this repository.

Refer to the `README.md` file inside each directory for further instructions on
how to run that specific API back-end.
